Initialising a repository.

Create a directory by using mkdir directory name

Make it a git repository by initialising the git files using the 
command git init

There are no commits created automatically and the git log will 
be empty

By using the command git add you can add files to the staging area,
which is an intermediate between uncommitted files and fully committed files
where you can determine exactly what changes you wish to commit

When writing your commit message, it is standard practice to make the message 
sound like a command rather in the present tense rather than a statement
in the past tense.

git diff with no arguments will show the differences between the files in the 
working directory and the files in the staging area.

git reset --hard will remove any changes to the files since the last commit
